# Hi! I'm Edward
I'm a passion-driven developer looking to get my grubby hands on whatever projects I can. Current vision: full-stack TypeScript developer.

### My projects
- 🧞 **wizzy wig** - [demo]() | [repo](): A WYSIWYG Markdown note-taking web app in development using a TypeScript MERN stack.
- 👨‍🎨 **Ed's Design System (EDS)** - [demo]() | [repo](): My very own UI component library built using Next.js, Storybook, and TypeScript!
- 👅 **tonguist** - [demo]() | [repo](): A language learning flashcards web app built with the MERN stack. A lovely little clone of Lingvist.
- 🧠 **brain train** - [demo]() | [repo](): React web games made straight out of DOM elements and state management.
- 💬 **ana** - [demo]() | [repo](): An anonymous "confessions" forum board made with Ruby on Rails. All bells and whistles included.
- 🦶 **Tic Tac Toe** - [demo]() | [repo](): Tic Tac, like the brand of those little mints, and toe, like your big toe. But also like the game.
